                  The genome is the entire set of genetic instructions found in
                  a cell. In humans, the genome consists of 23 pairs of
                  chromosomes, found in the nucleus, as well as a small
                  chromosome found in the cells&apos; mitochondria. Each set of
                  23 chromosomes contains approximately 3.1 billion bases of DNA
                  sequence.

                  DNA is the chemical name for the molecule that carries genetic
                  instructions in all living things. The DNA molecule consists
                  of two strands that wind around one another to form a shape
                  known as a double helix. Each strand has a backbone made of
                  alternating sugar (deoxyribose) and phosphate groups. Attached
                  to each sugar is one of four bases--adenine (A), cytosine (C),
                  guanine (G), and thymine (T). The two strands are held
                  together by bonds between the bases; adenine bonds with
                  thymine, and cytosine bonds with guanine. The sequence of the
                  bases along the backbones serves as instructions for
                  assembling protein and RNA molecules.

                aThe gene is the basic physical unit of inheritance. Genes are
                passed from parents to offspring and contain the information
                needed to specify traits. Genes are arranged, one after another,
                on structures called chromosomes. A chromosome contains a
                single, long DNA molecule, only a portion of which corresponds
                to a single gene. Humans have approximately 20,000 genes
                arranged on their chromosomes.

                  An untranslated region (or UTR) refers to either of two
                  sections, one on each side of a coding sequence on a strand of
                  mRNA. If it is found on the 5&apos; side, it is called the
                  5&apos; UTR (or leader sequence), or if it is found on the
                  3&apos; side, it is called the 3&apos; UTR (or trailer
                  sequence). mRNA is RNA that carries information from DNA to
                  the ribosome, the site of protein synthesis (translation)
                  within a cell. The mRNA is initially transcribed from the
                  corresponding DNA sequence and then translated into protein.
                  However, several regions of the mRNA are usually not
                  translated into protein, including the 5&apos; and 3&apos;
                  UTRs.

                  A stop codon is a trinucleotide sequence within a messenger
                  RNA (mRNA) molecule that signals a halt to protein synthesis.
                  The genetic code describes the relationship between the
                  sequence of DNA bases (A, C, G, and T) in a gene and the
                  corresponding protein sequence that it encodes. The cell reads
                  the sequence of the gene in groups of three bases. Of the 64
                  possible combinations of three bases, 61 specify an amino
                  acid, while the remaining three combinations are stop codons.

                  Transcription is the process of making an RNA copy of a gene
                  sequence. This copy, called a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule,
                  leaves the cell nucleus and enters the cytoplasm, where it
                  directs the synthesis of the protein, which it encodes.

                  Transcription is one of the fundamental processes that happens
                  to our genome. It&apos;s the process of turning DNA into RNA.
                  And you may have heard about the central dogma, which is DNA,
                  to RNA, to protein. Well, transcription refers to that first
                  part of going from DNA to RNA. And we transcribe DNA to RNA in
                  specific places. The most popular places are those things that
                  code for these protein-encoding genes. But there are a whole
                  host of other RNAs that get transcribed, like transfer RNAs
                  and ribosomal RNAs, that do other functions that are genomic
                  as well.

                  Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a molecule similar to DNA. Unlike
                  DNA, RNA is single-stranded. An RNA strand has a backbone made
                  of alternating sugar (ribose) and phosphate groups. Attached
                  to each sugar is one of four bases--adenine (A), uracil (U),
                  cytosine (C), or guanine (G). Different types of RNA exist in
                  the cell: messenger RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and
                  transfer RNA (tRNA). More recently, some small RNAs have been
                  found to be involved in regulating gene expression.

                  RNA, or ribonucleic acid, is a nucleic acid that is similar in
                  structure to DNA but different in subtle ways. The cell uses
                  RNA for a number of different tasks, one of which is called
                  messenger RNA, or mRNA. And that is the nucleic acid
                  information molecule that transfers information from the
                  genome into proteins by translation. Another form of RNA is
                  tRNA, or transfer RNA, and these are non-protein encoding RNA
                  molecules that physically carry amino acids to the translation
                  site that allows them to be assembled into chains of proteins
                  in the process of translation.

                  An exon is the portion of a gene that codes for amino acids.
                  In the cells of plants and animals, most gene sequences are
                  broken up by one or more DNA sequences called introns. The
                  parts of the gene sequence that are expressed in the protein
                  are called exons, because they are expressed, while the parts
                  of the gene sequence that are not expressed in the protein are
                  called introns, because they come in between--or interfere
                  with--the exons.

                  Exons are that part of the RNA that code for proteins. Now,
                  RNA, when it first gets transcribed, is a very, very long
                  piece of RNA molecule. And really, the important parts of that
                  RNA are the exons. There are large, large chunks of RNA that
                  get excised out. Now, it&apos;s important to remember that
                  because I use the term excised doesn&apos;t mean that exons go
                  away. The exons are what stay in the mature mRNA and
                  eventually code for amino acids. Many times, including medical
                  students like my wife, will forget whether it&apos;s the exons
                  that code for the amino acids or the introns that code for the
                  amino acids. Let me set the record straight that it&apos;s the
                  exons that code for the amino acids, because sometimes people
                  try to remember that exons get excised, but that&apos;s not
                  true. It&apos;s that introns interfere. So you always have to
                  remember that introns interfere, and the introns get excised
                  out of the RNA to leave a string of exons together that will
                  eventually code for the amino acids.

                  An intron is a portion of a gene that does not code for amino
                  acids. In the cells of plants and animals, most gene sequences
                  are broken up by one or more introns. The parts of the gene
                  sequence that are expressed in the protein are called exons,
                  because they are expressed, while the parts of the gene
                  sequence that are not expressed in the protein are called
                  introns, because they come in between the exons.

                  Introns are very large chunks of RNA within a messenger RNA
                  molecule that interfere with the code of the exons. And these
                  introns get removed from the RNA molecule to leave a string of
                  exons attached to each other so that the appropriate amino
                  acids can be encoded for.

                  Messenger RNA (mRNA) is a single-stranded RNA molecule that is
                  complementary to one of the DNA strands of a gene. The mRNA is
                  an RNA version of the gene that leaves the cell nucleus and
                  moves to the cytoplasm where proteins are made. During protein
                  synthesis, an organelle called a ribosome moves along the
                  mRNA, reads its base sequence, and uses the genetic code to
                  translate each three-base triplet, or codon, into its
                  corresponding amino acid.

                  Messenger RNAs, also known as mRNA, are one of the types of
                  RNA that are found in the cell. This particular one, like most
                  RNAs, are made in the nucleus and then exported to the
                  cytoplasm where the translation machinery, the machinery that
                  actually makes proteins, binds to these mRNA molecules and
                  reads the code on the mRNA to make a specific protein. So in
                  general, one gene, the DNA for one gene, can be transcribed
                  into an mRNA molecule that will end up making one specific
                  protein.

                  during protein synthesis. The genetic code describes the

                  A codon is a trinucleotide sequence of DNA or RNA that
                  corresponds to a specific amino acid. The genetic code
                  describes the relationship between the sequence of DNA bases
                  (A, C, G, and T) in a gene and the corresponding protein
                  sequence that it encodes. The cell reads the sequence of the
                  gene in groups of three bases. There are 64 different codons:
                  61 specify amino acids while the remaining three are used as
                  stop signals.

                  Amino acids are a set of 20 different molecules used to build
                  proteins. Proteins consist of one or more chains of amino
                  acids called polypeptides. The sequence of the amino acid
                  chain causes the polypeptide to fold into a shape that is
                  biologically active. The amino acid sequences of proteins are
                  encoded in the genes.

                  A peptide is one or more amino acids linked by chemical bonds.
                  The term also refers to the type of chemical bond that joins
                  the amino acids together. A series of linked amino acids is a
                  polypeptide. The cell&apos;s proteins are made from one or

                Proteins are an important class of molecules found in all living
                cells. A protein is composed of one or more long chains of amino
                acids, the sequence of which corresponds to the DNA sequence of
                the gene that encodes it. Proteins play a variety of roles in

                (muscle), biochemical (enzymes), and cell signaling (hormones).

                Many genes in the genome code for proteins. These are molecules
                of amino acids linked together in a very specific sequence that
                produce a functional molecule that can fold up to either be an
                enzyme, or a formed part of the structure of the cell, or to be
                secreted and act as signals. In all, there are thousands and
                thousands of proteins that your cells and body makes every
                single day. In the human genome, there are approximately 20,000
                genes that code for proteins.
